         <h3 align="center"><b>5 Mark Question</b></h3>
        
     
            <h1 class="question">1. Explain the techniques of Auditing.</h1>
            
            <div class="answer">
             
              <p>These are the techniques by which an auditor obtains evidence about the transactions recorded in the books of accounts. There are various techniques of audit</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Inspection</b></li>
        <p>It consists of examination of records, documents and tangible assets. Examination of documents is one of the most important techniques of auditing. Authorisation refers to that there is a proper approval for the transaction.</p>
        
       <li><b>Observation</b></li>
         <p>The auditor may observe stock taking done by the staff.
  <ul>
        <li>Admission Procedure in College</li>
        <li>Security Observation</li>
        <li>Fuel Filling at Petrol Pumps</li>
        <li>Examination Time - Observing Students Trying to Copy</li>
        <li>Observing → Selection - Buying - Packing - Delivery - Goods in Departmental Stores/Mall</li>
    </ul><br>

       <li><b>Enquiry/Inquiry and Confirmation</b></li>
       
       
     <p>  It amounts to seeking appropriate information from a right person i.e. a person who has got knowledge of the transactions. The auditor may make enquiry by asking oral questions to the concerned persons. Alternatively, he may prepare a questionnaire and send it to the right persons with a request to complete the same and send back to the auditor.</p>   

    
       <li><b>Computaion</b></li>
       
       
     <p>It refers, to checking the arithmetical accuracy of the transactions recorded in the books of accounts. The auditor may follow the same procedures as is followed by the accountant for verifying arithmetical accuracy.</p>   
       
       <li><b>Analytical Review</b></li>
     <p>It implies studying important ratios and trends and investigating into the unusual 2.3 fluctuations. While auditing financial statements the auditor can correlate various figures in 1. order to establish financial soundness of the company. During the course of audit the auditor can scan various unusual transactions and examine them thoroughly. Proper scanning of the transactions requires greater degree of skill on the part of the auditor.</p>   

    </ol>
        </div>
     <h1 class="question">2. what are the duties of an Auditor with regard to internal Control.</h1>
            
            <div class="answer">
             
             <p><b>1. Responsibility of Management</b></p>
    <p>The internal control system is designed and established by management. It primarily involves the duty of management to establish internal control. The Auditor is entitled to rely upon safeguards and internal control instituted by the Management.</p>
    
    <p><b>2. Need for Evaluation</b></p>
    <p>The Auditor has to ascertain that transactions are executed according to the authorisation of Management. He is interested in ascertaining that all transactions are recorded properly and are adequately safeguarded.</p>
    
    <p><b>3. Need for Assurance</b></p>
    <p>The Auditor requires reasonable assurance that the accounting system is adequate. This includes assurance that all accounting information is recorded in a correct, proper, and timely manner.</p>
    
    <p><b>4. Audit Planning and Programme</b></p>
    <p>The Auditor should gain an understanding of the accounting and related internal controls to evaluate the operations of these controls.</p>
    
   <p><b>5. Review of Internal Control System</b></p>
    <p>The Auditor needs to review the internal control system established by his client. He should identify weaknesses and suggest improvements.</p>
    
    <p>He should write a letter of weaknesses with the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a) List arrears of weaknesses.</li>
        <li>b) Offer suggestions for improvements.</li>
        <li>c) Help the management to rectify the weaknesses.</li>
        <li>d) Help the auditor to minimize his legal liability.</li>
    </ul>
        </div>
        <h1 class="question">3. what are the duties of an Auditor with regard to internal Check.</h1>
            
            <div class="answer">
             
             <ul>
    <li><b>Auditor's Duty In Respect of Internal Check</b>
        <ul>
            <li>The auditor may depend on Test Check if the system of internal check is full proof. However, the auditor should keep in mind that his liability is not reduced under any circumstance.</li>
            <li>In the organisation where there is no internal control and the clerk has full control over all the books of accounts, it would be better if he checks all the transactions.</li>
            <li>In the organisation where there is a good system of internal check, the auditor may rely upon it to a greater extent and apply a few test checks.</li>
            <li>During the course of examination, if he comes across any mistake, he should go into the details of it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SA 400 has made the following recommendations in this case:</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Recommendations</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Establishment of the system:</b> Basically the management is responsible for establishment of the internal check system.</li>
            <li><b>Reliability:</b> The auditor should verify the reliability of the system of internal check.</li>
            <li><b>Evaluation:</b> The auditor should evaluate the system to ensure that the system prevents errors and frauds. It ensures that all transactions are properly recorded.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Understanding the system:</b> The auditor should get full knowledge of the system by having discussion with managers and by studying the manuals.</li>
                    <li><b>Application of test:</b> He should test check the application of the system.</li>
                    <li><b>Judgement:</b> He should judge whether the system is proper.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Reporting:</b> Under MAOCARO, the auditor has to report:
                <ul>
                    <li>a) Whether a service company has reasonable system of recording receipts, issues and consumption of materials and stores and allocation of materials consumed to the relative jobs.</li>
                    <li>b) Whether a service company has a reasonable system of allocating man-hours utilised to the relative jobs.</li>
                    <li>c) Whether there is a reasonable system of authorisation at proper levels on issue of stores and allocation of stores and labour to jobs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <div class="answer">
             
             <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Existence:</strong> 
            The auditor should confirm that all the assets of the company are physically existing on the date of the Balance Sheet. 
            It is possible that machinery is destroyed by an accident and scrapped but still appears in the books. 
            On verification, the auditor can find out that it is not existing, and then it can be rectified.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Possession:</strong> 
            The auditor has to verify that the assets are in the possession of the company on the date of the Balance Sheet. 
            For example, if an old machinery is sold for 65,000 but not recorded in the books of accounts, the auditor can check possession during verification and rectify the error.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Ownership:</strong> 
            The auditor should confirm that the asset is legally owned by the company. 
            If a vehicle is in the name of an employee as per the Registration Book, it cannot be treated as a company asset. 
            The invoice and entry in the Registration Book should be in the company's name to establish ownership rights.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Charge or Lien:</strong> 
            The auditor should verify whether the asset is subject to any charge or lien. 
            The fact of the charge should be disclosed in financial statements.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Record:</strong> 
            The auditor should confirm that the assets and liabilities are recorded in the books and that there is no omission of any asset or liability. 
            The auditor should ensure that no bogus asset or liability is recorded.
        </li>
    </ol>
