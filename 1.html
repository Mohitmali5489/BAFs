     <h1 class="question"><strong>14. Explain the relationship between IQ, EQ, and SQ. Which one is the most important according to you? Justify your answer.</strong></h1>
        <div class="answer">
        <p>IQ (Intelligence Quotient), EQ (Emotional Quotient), and SQ (Social Quotient) are three different aspects of intelligence that influence a person's success and well-being:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>IQ (Intelligence Quotient):</b> Measures a person's logical reasoning, problem-solving ability, and intellectual potential.</li>
        <li><b>EQ (Emotional Quotient):</b> Measures emotional intelligence, which includes understanding, managing, and expressing emotions effectively.</li>
        <li><b>SQ (Social Quotient):</b> Measures a person's ability to interact with others, build relationships, and work in a social environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While all three are important, EQ is often considered the most crucial because it plays a key role in handling emotions, managing relationships, and making rational decisions under pressure. A person with high EQ can work well with others, manage stress effectively, and navigate social situations successfully, making it a vital skill for both personal and professional life.</p>
       
    </div>
     <h1 class="question"><strong>15. Do you think some life skills are more important than others? Why or why not?</strong></h1>
        <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes, some life skills are more important than others, depending on the situation and the individual's role in life. For instance, in professional settings, communication, problem-solving, and teamwork are crucial, while in personal life, emotional intelligence and decision-making play a significant role.</p>
    <p>However, all life skills are interconnected. A person who is a good communicator but lacks problem-solving abilities may struggle in critical situations. Similarly, someone with strong decision-making skills but poor interpersonal skills may find it difficult to work in a team. Therefore, while some skills may be prioritized in specific circumstances, a balanced development of all life skills is necessary for overall growth and success.</p>
