<h2>Question Bank</h2>

    <h3 align="center"><b>Module 1</b></h3>
    
    <p class="question"><strong>1. What is data visualization and its importance.</strong></p>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Data visualization translates complex data sets into visual formats that are easier for the human brain to understand. This can include a variety of visual tools such as:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li><b>Charts</b>: Bar charts, line charts, pie charts, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Graphs</b>: Scatter plots, histograms, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Maps</b>: Geographic maps, heat maps, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Dashboards</b>: Interactive platforms that combine multiple visualizations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1. Data Visualization Simplifies the Complex Data</strong>: Large and complex data sets can be challenging to understand. Data visualization helps break down complex information into simpler, visual formats making it easier for the audience to grasp.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Enhances Data Interpretation</strong>: Visualization highlights patterns, trends, and correlations in data that might be missed in raw data form. This enhanced interpretation helps in making informed decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Data Visualization Saves Time</strong>: It is definitely faster to gather some insights from the data using data visualization rather than just studying a chart.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Improves Communication</strong>: Visual representations of data make it easier to share findings with others, especially those who may not have a technical background. This is important in business where stakeholders need to understand data-driven insights quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Data Visualization Tells a Data Story</strong>: Data visualization is also a medium to tell a data story to the viewers. The visualization can be used to present the data facts in an easy-to-understand form while telling a story and leading the viewers to an inevitable conclusion. This data story should have a good beginning, a basic plot, and an ending that it is leading towards.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="question"><strong>2. List the Types of Data Visualization Techniques.</strong></p>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Creating a chart from data is the first step in creating a data story that could inform people and even change their minds. These charts are intuitive and easy to create while providing quick information about the data to viewers. So let’s see the different types of charts in Tableau.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Bar Chart</strong>: A Bar chart organizes the data into rectangular bars that can easily be used to compare data sets. You can create a bar chart if you want to compare two or more data values of a similar kind and if you don’t have too many data groups to display.</p><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200629123327/Barchart.png">
        <p><strong>2. Line Chart</strong>: A Line Chart visualizes data in the form of a line that is very useful in understanding trends and patterns. It’s best to use the Line Chart if you want to show data relative to a continuous variable like time. Different colored lines for different variables in the data make it very easy to understand a line chart.</p><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200629123502/LineChart.png">
        <p><strong>3. Area Chart</strong>: An Area Chart is similar to a Line Chart in that it also visualizes the data in the form of a line that is very useful in understanding trends and patterns. However, the area under the line in an area chart is also colored. This can be used with multiple variables in the data to demonstrate the relative differences between the variables.</p><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200629123528/Areachart.png">
        <p><strong>4. Pie Chart</strong>: A Pie chart is the best option if you want to compare some parts of the whole in the data. It can easily give an idea of the number of different parts on the whole but a disadvantage is that a pie chart is not very precise unless you add numerical values to each part of the pie chart representing the individual share on the whole.</p><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200629123553/Piechart.png">

    <p class="question"><strong>3. Write a short note on radar chart.</strong></p>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>A <strong>radar chart</strong> (also known as a <strong>spider chart</strong> or <strong>web chart</strong>) is a graphical tool used to display multivariate data in a way that shows values for several variables in a two-dimensional space. The chart consists of a series of axes starting from the same point, each representing a different variable. The data points for each variable are plotted along these axes, and they are connected to form a closed shape.</p>
        <p>Key features of radar charts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Axes</strong>: Each axis represents a different variable, typically arranged in a circular fashion.</li>
            <li><strong>Scale</strong>: The axes have a common scale, and the data points are plotted based on their value in relation to this scale.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison</strong>: The chart makes it easy to compare multiple variables across different categories or entities.</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="question"><strong>4. Write a short note on candlestick chart.</strong></p>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>A <strong>candlestick chart</strong> is a popular financial chart used to visualize price movements of a security, such as stocks, commodities, or currencies, over a specific time period. It provides a detailed view of market trends by displaying the open, high, low, and close prices for each time interval (e.g., a day, an hour).</p>
        <p>Key components of a candlestick:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Body</strong>: The thick rectangular part of the candlestick, representing the range between the open and close prices. If the close price is higher than the open price, the body is typically hollow or colored green (bullish). If the close price is lower than the open price, the body is filled or colored red (bearish).</li>
            <li><strong>Wicks (or Shadows)</strong>: The thin lines above and below the body, showing the highest and lowest prices during the time period. The top wick shows the high, and the bottom wick shows the low.</li>
            <li><strong>Bullish vs. Bearish</strong>: A bullish candlestick indicates the price closed higher than it opened, while a bearish candlestick indicates the price closed lower than it opened.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Candlestick charts are useful for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identifying price trends</strong>: They provide insights into market sentiment, indicating whether the market is in an uptrend or downtrend.</li>
            <li><strong>Predicting potential reversals</strong>: Specific candlestick patterns, like "doji," "hammer," or "engulfing," are often used to predict potential price reversals.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyzing market volatility</strong>: The length of the wicks and body can indicate the level of price volatility.</li>
        </ul>
