            <h1 class="question">1. What is Consignment and Parties to consignment</h1>
            
            <div class="answer">
             
             Consignment is when one person (the <b>consignor</b>) gives goods to another person or business (the <b>consignee</b>) to sell on their behalf. The consignor still owns the goods until they are sold. Once sold, the consignee takes a commission and gives the rest of the money to the consignor.<br><br>

    <b>Parties in Consignment:</b><br>
    1. <b>Consignor</b> – The owner of the goods who sends them for sale (e.g., a manufacturer or wholesaler).<br>
    2. <b>Consignee</b> – The person or business that receives the goods and sells them (e.g., a shop or dealer).<br><br>

    <b>Example:</b> A clothing brand (<b>consignor</b>) sends clothes to a boutique (<b>consignee</b>). The boutique sells the clothes and gives the money (minus commission) back to the brand.<br><br>

        <h1 class="question">2. Types of Commission in Consignment (Distinguish May Come)</h1>
            
            <div class="answer">
             
              1. <b>Ordinary Commission:</b> A fixed percentage of the total sales value.<br>
       Example: If the commission is <b>5%</b> and goods worth <b>₹10,000</b> are sold, the commission is <b>₹500</b>.<br><br>
    2. <b>Del Credere Commission:</b> Extra commission given to the consignee for taking responsibility for bad debts.<br>
       Example: If a consignee gets <b>5% ordinary commission</b> and <b>2% del credere commission</b>, they earn extra for ensuring all payments are collected.<br><br>
    3. <b>Overriding Commission:</b> Additional commission given for selling goods at a higher price, selling special products, or reaching a sales target.<br>
       Example: A consignee may get an extra <b>3% commission</b> for selling a premium brand or exceeding a monthly sales goal.<br><br>

        <h1 class="question">5. Types of Branches in Branch Accounts</h1>
            
            <div class="answer">
             
               1. <b>Dependent Branch:</b> The branch does not keep its own accounts; all transactions are recorded by the head office (HO). The branch only maintains stock and cash records. The HO sends goods and manages all major expenses.<br>
       <b>Example:</b> A clothing store with multiple outlets, where all decisions are controlled by the main office.<br><br>
    
    2. <b>Independent Branch:</b> The branch maintains its own accounts and prepares financial statements. It can purchase goods, manage expenses, and handle cash independently. At the end of the year, it sends reports to the HO.<br>
       <b>Example:</b> A multinational company with separate branches in different countries, each managing its own finances.<br><br>
    
    3. <b>Foreign Branch:</b> A branch located in a different country, following local currency and accounting rules. It operates like an independent branch but must report to the head office in the parent company’s currency.<br>
       <b>Example:</b> An Indian company with a branch in the USA.<br><br>
    
    4. <b>Wholesale Branch:</b> Sells goods in bulk (wholesale) instead of directly to customers. Helps expand distribution without relying on third-party wholesalers.<br>
       <b>Example:</b> A manufacturer’s branch that supplies goods to retailers instead of individual customers.<br><br>
