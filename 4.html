    <div class="answer">
        <p>Social Media Marketing (SMM) plays a critical role in the <strong>digital landscape</strong> due to the vast and ever-growing presence of social platforms in people's daily lives. The importance of SMM can be broken down into several key factors:</p>

With options for both organic and paid content, businesses of all sizes—whether small startups or large corporations—can leverage social media to promote their products or services without breaking the bank. Ads on platforms like Facebook and Instagram can be tailored to fit virtually any budget.</p>
